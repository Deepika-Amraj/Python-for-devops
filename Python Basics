üõ†Ô∏è Task 1: Install Python & Check Version
I installed Python on my system and verified the version:

Commands I Used:
Windows Installation: Download and install from the official website.

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3.6
python3 --version

Here‚Äôs a brief overview of Python's basic data types with examples:

1. Numbers:
Used to store numeric values.
Types include integers, floats, and complex numbers.
Examples:
age = 25        # Integer
temperature = 98.6  # Float
complex_num = 3 + 5j  # Complex number

2. Strings:
A sequence of characters, enclosed in quotes (single or double).
Useful for storing text data.
Examples:
name = "Deepika"
greeting = 'Hello, World!'

3. Lists:
Ordered, changeable collection of items.
Allows duplicates and can hold different data types.
Examples:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
mixed_list = [1, "hello", 3.5]

4. Tuples:
Ordered, unchangeable collection of items (immutable).
Uses parentheses () and allows duplicates.
Examples:
coordinates = (10.5, 25.0)
person_info = ("John", 30, "Engineer")

5. Dictionaries:
Unordered, changeable collection of key-value pairs.
Keys are unique, values can be any data type.
Examples:
student = {"name": "Alice", "age": 22, "grade": "A"}

6. Booleans:
Represents two values: True or False.
Useful for logical conditions and control flow.
Copy code
is_sunny = True
has_access = False
